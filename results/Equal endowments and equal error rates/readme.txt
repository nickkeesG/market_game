The following results were done with varying numbers of agents and error rates, where each of their error rates are the same, as well as their endowments.

This means that each agent either receives the signal 'a' or 'b', and all signals are equally informative to the agents.

If the error rate is 0.4, then receiving a signal 'a' will give an agent a belief of 0.6, and a signal 'b' will give a belief of 0.4. 

As you can see by the results, the market price is always bounded by the maximum (or minimum) belief of the agents. In the case above, the market price may never be above 0.6, even if all agents receive the signal 'a'.
