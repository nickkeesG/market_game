Because all endowments must be greater than or equal to zero, and they must all sum to one, I've come up with the following way to sample endowments.
1) each agent gets and endowment sampled from abs(Normal(0, sigma/N)) for N agents
2) normalize the endowment profile such that the endowments sum to 1
